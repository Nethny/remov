# remov
**Inspiration

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Our aim is to expand the capabilities of blockchain and make a secure way for transferring NFT between RMRK and MOVR blockchain.

**The Bridge

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The newly created bridge REMOV will allow you to safely transfer NFT from RMRK to MOVR and backwards. You will be able to take advantages of both networks!

**How we build it

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Our team writes a secure contract which collects your composed NFT on RMRK and reproduces it on the MOVR network.

**Challenges we face

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The mechanics and security of transfer and retranslation to MOVR has yet to be worked through.

**What we learned

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We have already found out how to make connections between the two networks, discovered ways to implement NFT in the MOVR network and the specifications and uniqueness of NFT on RMRK.

**What's next for REMOV

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Our further plan is to supplement the bridge with the ability to transfer NFT from the MOVR network to RMRK.

**Additional advantages

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As a result, our team will create a bridge that will also be used in our game called the Battle of Eternity.
